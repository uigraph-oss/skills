# Confirmation Workflow

This skill must plan first and generate only after explicit approval.

## Required Order

1. Discover project evidence from the repository and user request.
2. Ask the user which artifact categories to generate.
3. Propose a final generation plan.
4. Wait for a message containing the word `Generate`.
5. Generate only the approved artifacts.
6. Validate and reset the generated structure through LLM/agent file inspection so the files are internally consistent.

## Artifact Selection Question

Ask the user what to generate before writing files. Use the discovered project evidence to make the choices concrete.

Suggested categories:

- API artifacts: OpenAPI, GraphQL, or gRPC specs.
- Service dependencies: other services or datastores this service depends on.
- Database artifacts: SQL schemas, NoSQL JSON schemas, or migration-derived schemas.
- Architecture diagrams: Mermaid diagrams with optional `context.json`.
- Documentation artifacts: README, markdown, HTML, PDF, or support docs.
- Test packs: smoke, regression, or manual test cases.
- Maps: maps, frames, focal points, and component links.
- Helper scripts: project-specific scripts under `.uigraph/scripts/`.

## Final Plan Format

Before generation, propose a final plan that includes:

- Artifact categories selected by the user.
- Files to create or update.
- Repository evidence used for each artifact.
- Assumptions that affect generated content.
- Helper scripts to create under `.uigraph/scripts/`, only if they directly generate approved artifacts. Include the script language.
- LLM validation checks to perform after generation.

Do not generate files in the same response as the final plan unless the user has already said `Generate`.

## Approval Word

Only this word authorizes artifact generation:

```text
Generate
```

The approval message must contain this word. "generate", "generate now", and "ok generate the artifacts" all count. Messages without it, such as "go ahead", "sounds good", or "yes", do not. If the word is missing, ask the user to confirm with `Generate`.

## Helper Script Rules

Generated helper scripts must be written only under `.uigraph/scripts/`.

Scripts must directly generate approved UiGraph artifacts. Do not create scripts whose only purpose is exploration, discovery, inspection, inventory, or reporting.

- Scripts must be written only in JavaScript, Python, or Bash (`.sh`).
- Use JavaScript for JavaScript-based projects, Python for Python-based projects, and Bash (`.sh`) when neither JavaScript nor Python is clearly the project language.
- If a script inspects project data, it must also write the approved artifact as its direct output.
- Useful generation scripts include generating OpenAPI from known route metadata or generating database schema files from known schema sources.

Do not create scripts in `scripts/`, `tools/`, or other project directories. Do not run live database dumps unless the user explicitly approves the database action and the project clearly contains the needed setup.

## Post-Generation Validation

After generation, the LLM/agent must verify and reset the generated structure by reading the generated files and reasoning through the rules.

- Check `.uigraph.yaml` is valid YAML.
- Check generated JSON files are valid JSON.
- Check every path referenced by `.uigraph.yaml` exists.
- Check OpenAPI, GraphQL, gRPC, SQL, Mermaid, and docs files are structurally plausible when generated.
- Check links between maps, test packs, APIs, docs, and architecture diagrams use matching names and operation IDs.
- Fix only files generated during the current execution.

Report any validation that cannot be performed and why.
